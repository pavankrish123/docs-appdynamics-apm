<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions for installing AppDynamics v1.x, see <a href="./installing_1_x.html">(Deprecated) Installing and Configuring AppDynamics APM (1.x version)</a>.</p>

This topic describes how to install and configure AppDynamics APM for VMware Tanzu.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting with v4.5.545, AppDynamics Analytics support has been moved
   to a separate tile on <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/">VMware Tanzu Network</a>.
   If you want to use Transactional Analytics, install AppDynamics Analytics for VMware Tanzu.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting with v4.7, the APM tile supports two options for configuring the Account Access Key used to communicate with the AppDynamics Controller. In order to use the obfuscated Account Access Key Secret field, AppDynamics recommends that users update both the APM tile and the AppDynamics buildpack to version 4.7.x or higher, and the Java buildpack to version 4.19.2 or higher. With versions previous to 4.19.2 of the Java buildpack or 4.7 of the AppDynamics Extension Buildpacks, use the unobfuscated Account Access Key field. Starting with version 5.0 of the APM tile, the unobfuscated field is deprecated and will be removed.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The use of the obfuscated Access Key Secret field will change how the Account Access Key is represented in VCAP_SERVICES. Any app bound to an AppDynamics marketplace service will need to use an updated buildpack to consume the new field (at restage). Node.js apps should be upgraded to use the AppDynamics Extension Buildpack, or change the require statement to reference the updated field.</p>

## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Overview

The diagram illustrates the results of installing the tile. An AppDynamics service broker is deployed as a VMware Tanzu application to the org and space appdynamics-org/appdynamics-space. Each controller configured in the tile is published to the AppDynamics marketplace service as a unique plan, which apps can bind to.

In addition, the tile publishes the AppDynamics extension buildpack, appdbuildpack, which supports multiple buildpack workflows.

## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Before You Start

Create a [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account if you do not have one.

## <a id='SSL'></a> Configuring SSL

If you are planning to use SSL, do the following based on the Controller type.

### <a id='SAAS'></a> SSL for SaaS AppDynamics Controllers

AppDynamics SaaS controller use DigiCert Global Root CA. The tile automatically imports the DigiCert Global Root CA into the keystore used by AppDynamics Machine Agent and the dashboard app, if present.

Enable the SSL checkbox in AppDynamics Machine Agent configuration.

### <a id='OnPrem'></a> SSL for OnPremise AppDynamics Controllers

For OnPremise Controller deployments, upload the root certificate for the internal CA that signed the Controller certificate for your OnPremise Controller in the security configuration of the BOSH Director.

For an example, see [Security Page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/vsphere-config.html#step-7-security-pane-7)
in the VMware Tanzu documentation.

Make sure to follow the exact format below while entering multiple certificates.

## <a id='set-up-the-service-broker-tile'></a> Set up the APM Tile

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. If the AppDynamics Service Broker tile does not appear in the Installation Dashboard, click **Import a Product** in the left-side menu and import the AppDynamics tile.

1. Double-click the **AppDynamics** tile in the Installation Dashboard.

### <a id='appd-controller-config'></a> AppDynamics Controller Setup

1. In the **Settings** tab, click **AppDynamics Controller Configuration**. Then click **Add**.
    ![alt-text=""](./images/install-02-appd-controller-config-add.png)

1. Enter the following Service Plan options. All of these fields are required.
  * **Controller Configuration Name** -- A user-friendly name for this configuration profile. This name should include the Controller to which the Standalone Machine Agent reports.
  * **Controller Configuration Description** -- A more complete description of this configuration profile.
  * **Account Name** -- The account name used to access the Controller. You must specify an account with a valid App Agent license. To check this, do the following:
       * In the Controller, click the gear icon (top right) and choose **License > Account > License**.
       * In the **Account Usage** tab, under **APM Usage**, verify that the account has at least one available license unit for the type of application you are monitoring (Java, .NET, etc.).
  * **Account Key Information** -- Input controller access key in only one of these fields.
     * **Account Access Secret (Recommended)** -- Hidden field to take in controller access key information
     * **Account Access Key (Soon to be Deprecated)** The account access key used to authenticate with the Controller. In the Controller, click the gear icon (top right) and choose **License > Account > Access Key**. Starting with Version 4.7.x, the APM tile supports two options for configuring the Account Access Key. AppDynamics recommends that users update both the APM tile and the AppDynamics buildpack to version 4.7.x or higher, and the Java buildpack to version 4.19.2 or higher, in order to use the obfuscated Account Access Key Secret field. With versions previous to 4.19.2 of the Java buildpack or 4.7 of the AppDynamics Extension Buildpacks, use the unobfuscated Account Access Key field.  The unobfuscated field is deprecated and will be removed starting from version 5.0 of the APM tile."
  * **Controller Host** -- The host name or the IP address of the AppDynamics Controller. Example values are 192.168.1.22 or myhost or myhost.example.com. This is the same host that you use to access the AppDynamics browser-based user interface. For an on-premises Controller, use the value for Application Server Host Name that was configured when the Controller was installed. If you are using the AppDynamics SaaS Controller service, see the welcome email from AppDynamics.
  * **Controller Port** -- The HTTP (unencrypted) port used to access the AppDynamics Controller web interface. Defaults are 8090 (on-premise Controllers) and 80 (SaaS Controllers).
  * **SSL Port** -- The HTTPS (encrypted) port used to access the AppDynamics Controller web interface. Defaults are 8181 (on-premise Controllers) and 443 (SaaS Controllers).

    ![alt-text=""](./images/install-03-controller-config-options.png)

1. You can add multiple controller configurations by repeating steps 4 and 5. This will enable applications to bind to any of the entered configurations.

2. Click **Save** to save the changes and return to the Installation Dashboard.

## <a id='validating-the-install'></a> Validating the Install

Once the tile install completes successfully in the Ops Manager, you can confirm that the Controller plans have been successfully installed using `cf marketplace`:


    $ cf marketplace -s appdynamics
    …
    service plan description free or paid
    my-controller1 controller1 free
    …

Confirm that the AppDynamics extension buildpack is available by using `cf buildpacks`:

    $ cf buildpacks
    buildpack position enabled locked filename
    …
    appdbuildpack 24 true false appdynamics_buildpack-v4.6.13.zip
